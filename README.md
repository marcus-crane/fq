# FQ

I don't remember what FQ stands for. It's just what the name of the folder was that contained this.

You might want to adapt it to a Jekyll template first although I might do that myself at some point.

It was inspired by Twitter I think? I don't know, it's just something that I found tucked away on my web server that I forgot about.
