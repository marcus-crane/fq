						I'd recommend this game to fans of the series who think they can play this with an open mind. The microtransactions are not as intrusive as you have heard and you might even find you enjoy the weapon crafting system! I wouldn't give it an award for story but I felt it was easily bearable since I enjoyed the gameplay anyway. Definitely not a perfect game but I found it fun.

						<br />
						P.S. To anyone who saw the leaked ending, like I did, the ending is not actually a QTE as you saw. Yes, there is a QTE as the last action you ever do so take what you want from that but there is indeed a final boss battle but I won't say anything else for fear of spoilers.

						A lot of you may have a bias toward the Sonic franchise which is completely understandable! I went into the demo of this game expecting a steaming pile of ass but it may be one of the better kart racers in recent times if not one of the best! It sort of innovates with the whole transforming vehicle thing which is actually neat since you have a different track each lap. It's a fairly neat game that's worth whatever price it is. I'm going to pick it up when it's on sale myself!
						<br />
						<br />
						P.S. By no means am I an expert of would I consider myself an expert. I played a buttload of Crash Team Racing as a kid and also played Crash Nitro Kart a little and "that open world game where you fused cars or something" but beyond that, I never got into the Kart Racing genre so if you're like me, this should be pretty accessible as a starting point.
